# Executive Summary - EDA on the impact of Covid-19 on New York City Taxi Services


#### The period of this study is set to be the intial period of the onset of infestion in the NYC area which is Monday 9th March to Sunday 7th June, where there was intial spike of infections. 

The important dates from Covid-19 infection related public announcment and proceedings into consideration are : 
1. 9th February - Initial Spike in Infection, 
2. 12th March - Restriction on Mass Gathering, 
3. 22nd Mar - Shelter in place orders, 
4. 8th June - Restrictions relaxed

### The Questions to be explored:
#### 1. What has been the impact of the pandemic on NYC taxi revenue over time?

During the onset of Covid-19 infection there has been a steep decline in revenue generation for the legacy of NYC the yellow-cab. At around the time when the public restrictions were imposed, 12th March 2020 - 22nd Mar 2020, the average renenue of yellow cab dropped from around 18-19 USD to below 15 USD.

Such gap in revenue sustained over an extensive period of time even beyond initial relaxation of restrictions on June 8th 2020.

For the "drop-off" favourites green-cab, the story is differnt though, from an average of mere 15 USD before the onset of pandemic to an up-scaled average of around 17 USD. During similar timeframe in the previous year the green-cab generated an average of around 15 USD - 16 USD.

Reference Fig 1 and Fig 2.

#### 2. What was the most expensive trip? Between what zones? Conversely what was the cheapest trip? What is the difference between these before and during the peak impact of the pandemic?

During week 10, where first onset of infection occoured in NYC, the most expensive and least expensive trip by 
Yellow-cab was between: 

Most Expensive Trip - 22_Brooklyn_Bensonhurst West_Boro Zone, 193_Queens_Queensbridge/Ravenswood_Boro Zone.
Least Expensive Trip - 141_Manhattan_Lenox Hill West_Yellow Zone, 140_Manhattan_Lenox Hill East_Yellow Zone. 

At week 11, when shelter in place was set,

Most Expensive - 10_Queens_Baisley Park_Boro Zone, 10_Queens_Baisley Park_Boro Zone.
Least Expensive - 238_Manhattan_Upper West Side North_Yellow Zone, 238_Manhattan_Upper West Side North_Yellow Zone.

At around week 10, during the same time last year(2019),

Most Expensive - 226_Queens_Sunnyside_Boro Zone, 226_Queens_Sunnyside_Boro Zone.
Least Expensive - 132_Queens_JFK Airport_Airports, 132_Queens_JFK Airport_Airports.

At week 11,

Most Expensive - 193_Queens_Queensbridge/Ravenswood_Boro Zone, 193_Queens_Queensbridge/Ravenswood_Boro Zone.
Least Expensive - 10_Queens_Baisley Park_Boro Zone, 230_Manhattan_Times Sq/Theatre District_Yellow.

During the peak impact of the initial pandemic there most expensive trips and even the least expensive trips are made within Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn borough zones. Where as before the pandemic during similar time frame previous year, most expensive trips are generally with the same borough zones of Manhattan or Queens or Boorklyn.
 
Similarly with green-cab we can observe that

In 2020 during the week 10

Most Expensive - 61_Brooklyn_Crown Heights North_Boro Zone, 17_Brooklyn_Bedford_Boro Zone
Least Expensive - 116_Manhattan_Hamilton Heights_Boro Zone, 116_Manhattan_Hamilton Heights_Boro Zone

During week 11,

Most Expensive - 223_Queens_Steinway_Boro Zone, 223_Queens_Steinway_Boro Zone
Least Expensive - 130_Queens_Jamaica_Boro Zone, 130_Queens_Jamaica_Boro Zone

Where as during the similar timeframe in 2019 we observed that,

During week 10,

Most Expensive - 42_Manhattan_Central Harlem North_Boro Zone, 42_Manhattan_Central Harlem North_Boro Zone
Least Expensive - 198_Queens_Ridgewood_Boro Zone, 198_Queens_Ridgewood_Boro Zone

During week 11,

Most Expensive - 193_Queens_Queensbridge/Ravenswood_Boro Zone, 193_Queens_Queensbridge/Ravenswood_Boro Zone
Least Expensive - 51_Bronx_Co-Op City_Boro Zone, 264_Unknown_NV_nan

Hence we can observe that during the peak impact of the onset of the pandemic at week 10,11 the "drop-off" favourite green cab, has most expensive trip with the same Borough zones of Manhattan and Queens.

#### 3. Whats the most popular payment method? Did this change because of the pandemic?

The payment behaviour during the onset of the initial peak of the pandemic has been the most surprising feature of this EDA. 

The most popular paymnet method has been $credit-card$ for NYC taxi services. Before the onset of Covid-19 the daily number of transactions for yellow-cab reached well over $200k$ per day but during the $intial peak$ of the pandemic when the restrictions were put in place, peoples behaviour changed dractically. The daily number of transactions for credit card fell almost to the $same level$ as cash transactions with very minimal edge over the former. This prefernce of transactional behaviour rmained sustained even after the restrictions were eased. 

In case of Green-Cab services, the insights are even more interesting during the pandemic the daily number of cash transactions $exceeded$ the daily credit card transaction by a narrow but sustainable margin. However, this behaviour seemed like starting to reverse where credit card transactions were taking presedence over the cash in the later half of the pandemic year, specially after the restrictions were eased.

Reference Fig 5 and Fig 6.

#### 4. Whats the most expensive day of the week to travel on? Did this change because of the pandemic?

Due to the nature of the pandemic both yellow-cab and green-cab had expereinced different customer behaviour.

During the peak of the pandemic the most expensive day of the week for yellow-cab has transfomed from being Thrusdays to Sundays during the same timeframe when compared to the previous year 2019.

A different behaviour is observed for "just-drop-offs" green-cab service which has got the most expensive on Wednesdays during covid-19 (2020) pandemic compared to Fridays during previous normal year (2019).
